## SPT Connect

SPT Connect provides for the South Pole Telescope Collaboration access to two dedicated login nodes: `amundsen.grid.uchicago.edu` and `scott.grid.uchicago.edu`. The nodes are used to submit production jobs to the Open Science Grid and other local High Throughput Computing resources. In addition, users can use SPTT Connect nodes for management of their collaborative data on the Connect Stash storage and run local analysis jobs.
